# chat-with-your-PDF
This project is a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. It allows you to process a PDF document and ask questions about its contents using a web interface. The backend is powered by a local Llama 3 model run via Ollama, with a Pinecone vector database for efficient document searching.
